linearKittens is an AI for automatically playing bloodrizer's Kittens Game:
http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/

USING THE AI

linearKittens needs to be loaded into the javascript console, which can be done with the command

document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://rawgit.com/dwhalen/linearKittens/master/linearKittens.js';

Wait a couple of seconds.  Once linearKittens has been loaded, it can be started and stopped by running respectively

startLinearKittens();
stopLinearKittens();

OTHER OPTIONS

linearKittens can be set to respect Iron Will mode by setting
doNotBuildHousing = true;

linearKittens can be set to only build housing-related buildings and housing-related research, so as to maximize number of kittens before a game reset, by setting
onlyBuildHousing = true;

USING THE AI AS A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SCRIPT

linearKittens can also be made less active.  Its capacity to build can be disabled, and the script can be made to just optimize production and keep resources from hitting the cap.  To set up linearKittens like this, do the following.  Load the AI by running

document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://rawgit.com/dwhalen/linearKittens/master/linearKittens.js';

Wait a couple of seconds.  Once linearKittens has been loaded, change the following settings by running these commands:

performUncappedTrades = false;
autoBuy = false;
scoreAccumulatedResources = true;
resourceCap = 0.9;

Once you change these settings, linearKittens can be started and stopped by running respectively

startLinearKittens();
stopLinearKittens();

If linearKittens is not planning for the resources you want, you can prioritize certain resources be modifying the resourceWeight object, like

resourceWeights['steel']=100;
console.log(resourceWeights);

This will also show you the resourceWeight object, which has the internal names for all of the resources.  Certain resources will not be crafted regardless.  If you prioritize scaffolds, for example, linearKittens will gather beams, but not convert them.

GUARANTEES

linearKittens comes with no guarantees explicit or implied.  It may not work with the most recent version of the Kittens Game.  It may break your computer.  It may turn all of your tradeships into oil tankers.  It may starve all of your kittens to death or otherwise leave a smoking crater of your once-great kitten hegemony.
